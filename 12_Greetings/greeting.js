//Question no 12 :Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each 
//person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each 
//message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var names = ["Ali", "Zakheer", "zaheer", "Osman"];
for (var i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    console.log("here is your good name", names[i]);
}
