//person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each 
//message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names:string[]=["Ali","Zakheer","zaheer","Osman"]
for(let i=0; i<names.length; i++){
    console.log(`here is your good name`,names[i]);
