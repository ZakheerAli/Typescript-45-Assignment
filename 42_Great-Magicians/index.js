//Question no 42:Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 41. Write a function called
// make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. 
//Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
var magician = ['herry', 'charlie', 'jhon', 'henry'];
function make_great(magicianarray) {
    for (var i = 0; i < magicianarray.length; i++) {
        magician[i] = "The great " + magicianarray[i];
    }
}
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    for (var _i = 0, magicians_1 = magicians; _i < magicians_1.length; _i++) {
        var ele = magicians_1[_i];
        console.log(ele);
    }
