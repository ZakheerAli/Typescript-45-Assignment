//Question no 45:Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should 
//always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword 
//arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color 
//or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored 
//correctly.


function storecarinfo(manufacturer:string,modelName:string, ...extraoption:{[key:string]:any}[]){
  let carinfo={
          manufacturer,
          modelName,
          ...Object.assign({},...extraoption)

  }
  return carinfo;
}
let result=storecarinfo("toyota","landcruiser",{color:"Black"},{features:["automatic","manual"]});
